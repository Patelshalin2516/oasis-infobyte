    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, 
        widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most 
        influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known
        for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made
        important contributions to the  development of the theory
        of quantum mechanics.</p>
        <p>
        In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis 
        ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.
         These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained 
         Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated
         massâ€“energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical 
         mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the 
         electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special 
         theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational 
         fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, 
         introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the 
         general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.
         He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and 
         quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and 
         the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties 
         of light and the quantum theory of radiation,which laid the 
         foundation of the photon theory of light.</p>
